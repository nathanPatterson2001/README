# Exercise

#### Exercising is something that I do really well for one week, and the weeks after that I start to fall off. Not going to lie, Im not very good at it. 

If I really started to do more of this I would follow [this workout routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sEeVJEXTfY) because the dude looks shredded and WI only to acheive 1/8 of what hes doing.

If Im looking for more of an old time feel then this is my target body:
